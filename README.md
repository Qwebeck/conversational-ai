# Idea

The bot is designed to act as an intermediary between Discord users and the Wikipedia platform. It will leverage the Wikipedia API to provide users with access to relevant information and resources from the platform directly through Discord.

Additionally, the bot will include a feature that allows users to receive recommendations for similar articles based on their search history or by passing an article as an argument. This feature will provide users with a personalized experience and facilitate discovery of related topics of interest.

Overall, the bot's functionality will enable users to seamlessly access and explore the vast resources available on Wikipedia without ever having to leave the Discord platform.
